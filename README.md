# Data Processing With Validation
## Introduction
This practical work focuses on the practical implementation of external data processing methods through validation. The primary objective is to familiarize oneself with various validation methods for input data.

## Objectives
- To reinforce the approach to processing external data through validation in practice.
- To explore different validation methods for input data.
## Tasks
1. Implement validation for the project using one of two approaches: either without exceptions or with exceptions.
2. If necessary, create additional fields for validation such as login, email, password, address, phone, URL, etc.
3. Each field should have an array of possible error messages. If a user commits 2 or more errors, display 2 or more hints. 
4. Utilize regular expressions for validation.
5. Add here to principles such as SOLID, GRASP, and other design principles.
## Usage
- Clone the repository.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Run the validation script.
- Follow the instructions provided to input data and observe the validation process.
## Contribution Guidelines
- Fork the repository.
- Create a new branch.
- Make your contributions.
- Ensure your code adheres to the established validation methods and principles.
- Submit a pull request.
